-- In 4.sql, write a SQL query to find the 50 players paid the least in 2001.

-- Sort players by salary, lowest to highest.
-- If two players have the same salary, sort alphabetically by first name and then by last name.
-- If two players have the same first and last name, sort by player ID.
-- Your query should return three columns, one for playersâ€™ first names, one for their last names, and one for their salaries.

WHERE s.year = 2001
ORDER BY s.salary ASC , p.first_name , p.last_name , p.id
